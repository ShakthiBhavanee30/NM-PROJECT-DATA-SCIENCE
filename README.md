# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about patients' demographics, behavioral factors, and medical history.

## Project Overview
The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Various machine learning models, such as Random Forest Classifier, are used to predict the risk of CVD based on the available data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains over 4,000 records and 15 attributes, including features like age, gender, cholesterol levels, and smoking status. The target variable is the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `CVD_Prediction.ipynb` to see the project code and analysis.
2. Modify the notebook as needed for your own analysis or dataset.

## Results
The analysis reveals important insights into the factors influencing CVD risk, such as age, cholesterol levels, and smoking status. The predictive models achieve an accuracy of over 80% in predicting the 10-year risk of CHD.

## Future Scope
- Integration of real-time data sources for continuous monitoring of CVD risk.
- Refinement of machine learning models using advanced algorithms.
- Implementation of personalized health interventions based on individual risk factors.
